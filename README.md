Welcome to the SocketWhisper. SocketWhisper is software written for fun and experimentation to find out the 
capabilities of Raspberry Pi and Java programming language. The SocketWhisper uses a Raspberry pi to act as 
a server in a server-client relationship model. Ideally clients should be personal PCs, although there are 
plans to utilize small Android phones that can act as both server and client in the future.
