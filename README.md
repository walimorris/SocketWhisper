Welcome to the SocketWhisper. The SocketWhisper is a simple program that uses a Raspberry pi to act as 
a server in a server-client relationship. Any PC connected to the network can act as client. With the 
SocketWhisper you can do many things; send messages throughout the network, update a repository holding 
data, send information through the web and more. Detailed instruction coming soon... stand by...
