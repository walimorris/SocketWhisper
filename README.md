Welcome to the SocketWhisper. SocketWhisper is software written for fun and experimentation to find out the 
capabilities of Raspberry Pi and Java programming language. The SocketWhisper uses a Raspberry pi to act as 
a server in a server-client relationship model. Ideally clients should be personal PCs, although there are 
plans to utilize small Android phones that can act as both server and client in the future. The idea of a 
Raspberry Pi as server is this: it knows things by utilizing an embedded Sqlite database that tells jokes 
and random historical facts. It does things such as request weather from nearly any place in the world and 
tells you more about the weather than you thought would ever be nessasary. Raspberry Pi as a server also has 
functions to request freely available photos from NASA, telling stories and showing photos of the known and 
captivating universe.
